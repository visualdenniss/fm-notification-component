# Frontend Mentor - Notifications page solution

This is a solution to the [Notifications page challenge on Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/notifications-page-DqK5QAmKbC).

This is a collaboration, open-source project. Main objectives are practice github and git workflows as well as apply the concepts and steps described in article [Thinking in React](https://beta.reactjs.org/learn/thinking-in-react).  

# HOW TO CONTRIBUTE?

Please read the resources below. 
- First fork this github repo and create a clone to work on it yourself.
- Then pull the repo to your local machine and run npm install && npm start in your terminal.
- Create a new branch to work on a new task or a feature. Make your changes there. 
- Once finished, push the code to your remote repo. 
- Create a Pull Request from your remote branch to master branch of the repo which you forked initially.
- Once your pull request is merged with the master branch, sync your repo to be up to date.
