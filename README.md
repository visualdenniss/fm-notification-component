# Frontend Mentor - Notifications page solution

This is a solution to the [Notifications page challenge on Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/notifications-page-DqK5QAmKbC).

This is a collaboration, open-source project. Main objectives are practice github and git workflows as well as apply the concepts and steps described in article [Thinking in React](https://beta.reactjs.org/learn/thinking-in-react).  

# HOW TO CONTRIBUTE?

Please read the resources below. 
- First fork this github repo and create a clone to work on it yourself.
- Then pull the repo to your local machine and run npm install && npm start in your terminal.
- Create a new branch to work on a new task or a feature. Make your changes there. 
- Once finished, push the code to your remote repo. 
- Create a Pull Request from your remote branch to master branch of the repo which you forked initially.
- Once your pull request is merged with the master branch, sync your repo to be up to date.

# Overview

## Workflow and TODOs 

See Workflow.md 

When making a new branch 
  - make sure repo fork is synced with 'forked', and get to 'master' branch
  - git checkout -b nextbranch
  - git branch --set-upstream-to=origin/master
  - git pull
  - start making changes
  - git add .
  - git commit -m 'commit keywords from the current branch'
  - git push __NO__
  - git push origin <branchwithcurrentchanges> __this will create the new branch on the remote (AKA MY REPOSITORY ON GITHUB.COM) repo and leave master alone__
    - this created an alert on github that wants me to compare & pull request. I dont know why I would do a pull request from my own repo, but lets see whats up.
    - also, while it may be nice to see the changes in each branch individually, I do NOT want to be forced to have to click buttons on github, potentially disturbing other branches or making unwanted changes. a button should not even be an option on other branched, dont need or want a pull request on other branches. their purpose is to see the changes in history and keep the material as is for that branch. - this is the case for every branch as well - I'm not understanding the point of a new branch for every change if it just wants to update every branch to the current state. Makes no sense to me but maybe I am viewing things wrong...




***
If you see something wrong here (like I don't have a fetch in here anywhere), make a new list below this line with the order of operations so reference can be made to the current 'mindset' of the order above.

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- Distinguish between "unread" and "read" notifications
- Select "Mark all as read" to toggle the visual state of the unread notifications and set the number of unread messages to zero
- View the optimal layout for the interface depending on their device's screen size
- See hover and focus states for all interactive elements on the page

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- Github and Git
